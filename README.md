# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository provides comprehensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++. The repository is organized as follows:

## Queues:
- **Simple Queue**: Basic queue implementation.
- **Circular Queue**: Queue with circular buffer to efficiently use memory.
- **Priority Queue**: Queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.

## Stacks:
- Detailed implementation of stack data structure.
- Real-world applications demonstrating the utility of stacks.

## Linked Lists:
- **Singly Linked List**: Nodes with a single link in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes with links in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: Nodes connected in a circular manner.

## Trees:
- **Binary Trees**: Basic tree structure with at most two children per node.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Binary trees with ordered nodes for efficient searching.
- **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing binary search trees.

## Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: Stable sorting algorithm using divide-and-conquer strategy.

## Searching Algorithms:
- **Linear Search**: Basic search technique for unsorted data.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm for sorted data.

Each section includes:
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations demonstrating the concepts.
- **Time Complexity**: Analysis of algorithm efficiency.
- **Applications**: Real-world use cases and scenarios.
